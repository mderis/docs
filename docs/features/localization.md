## Select Request Language

You can select the language of the response by adding the header `Accept-Language` to the request. By default the 
`Accept-Language` is set to the language defined in `config/app.php` `locale`. 

Please note that `Accept-Language` only determines, that the client _would like_ to get the information in this specific
language. It is not given, that the API responds in this language!

When the `Accept-Language` header is missing, the default locale will be applied.

> **Heads up!**
> Please be sure that your client does not send an `Accept-Language` header automatically. Some REST clients 
(e.g., `POSTMAN`) automatically add header-fields based on the operating-systems settings. So your `Accept-Language` header
may be set automatically without knowing!

The API will answer with the applied language in the `Content-Language` header of the response.

If the requested language cannot be resolved (e.g., it is not defined) the API throws an `UnsupportedLanguageException` to tell 
the client about this.

The overall workflow of the Middleware is as follows:
1) Extract the `Accept-Language` field from the request header. If none is set, use the default locale from the config file
2) Build a list of all supported localizations based on the configuration of the respective container. If a language 
(top level) contains regions (sub-level), order them like this: `['en-GB', 'en-US', 'en']` (the regions before languages, 
as regions are more specific)
3) Check, if the value from 1) is within the list from 2). If the value is within this list, set it as application language, 
if not throw an `Exception`.

## Support new language

1. All supported languages must be added to the `supported_languages` in `app/Containers/Localization/Configs/localization.php` 
to prevent users from requesting unsupported languages, as follow:

```php
<?php

    'supported_languages' => [
        'ar',
        'en' => [
            'en-GB',
            'en-US',
        ],
        'es',
        'fr',
    ],
```

2. Create new languages files:

Languages file can be placed in any container, not only the Localization Container. Refer to the [Localization]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/features/localization.md %}) 
page for more info.

Example languages files are included in the Localization Container at `app/Containers/Localization/Resources/Languages`.

## Translating Strings

By default all the Container translation files are namespaced to the Container name.

**Example:**

If a Container named `Store` has `en` translation file called `notifications` that contains translation for `welcome` 
like "Welcome to our store :)". You can access this translation as follow `trans('store::notifications.welcome')`. If 
you remove the namespace (which is the lowercase of the container name) and try to access it like this 
`trans('notifications.welcome')` it will not find your translation and will print `notifications.welcome` only.

> **Heads up!**
> If you try to load a string for a language that is **not available** (e.g., there is no folder for this language), Apiato 
will stick to the default one that is defined in `app.locale` config file. This is also true, if the requested locale 
is present in the `supported_languages` array from the configuration file.

## Disable Localization

You will need to remove the Localization Middleware, by simply going to `app/Containers/Localization/Providers/MainServiceProvider.php` 
and removing the `MiddlewareServiceProvider` from the `$serviceProviders` property.

## Get Available Localizations

Apiato provides a convenient way to get all defined localizations. These localizations can be retrieved via `GET /localizations` 
by default. Note that this route only outputs the "top level" locales, like `en` from the example above. However, if 
specific regions (e.g., `en-US`) are defined, these will show up in the result as well.

The `Transformer` for the localizations not only provide the `language` (e.g., `de`), but also outputs the name of the 
language in this specific language (e.g., `locale_name => Deutsch`). Furthermore, the language name is outputted in the 
applications default name (e.g., configured in `app.locale`). This would result in `default_name => German`.
 
The same applies to the regions that are defined (e.g., `de-DE`). Consequently, this results in `locale_name => Deutschland` 
and `default_name = Germany`.

## Tests

To change the default language in your tests requests. You can set the `env` language in the `phpunit.xml` file.
